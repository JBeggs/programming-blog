        title: "Beginner Ubuntu",
        body: `Linux was already established in 2004, but it was fragmented into proprietary and unsupported community editions, 
        and free software was not a part of everyday life for most computer users. That’s when Mark Shuttleworth gathered a small 
        team of Debian developers who together founded Canonical and set out to create an easy-to-use Linux desktop called Ubuntu.
        <br /><br />
        The mission for Ubuntu is both social and economic. First, we deliver the world’s free software, freely, 
        to everybody on the same terms. Whether you are a student in India or a global bank, you can download and 
        use Ubuntu free of charge. Second, we aim to cut the cost of professional services - support, management, 
        maintenance, operations - for people who use Ubuntu at scale, through a portfolio of services provided by Canonical which 
        ultimately fund the improvement of the platform.

We bring the spirit of Ubuntu to the world of computers and software. The Ubuntu distribution represents the best of what the world’s software community has shared with the world.",
